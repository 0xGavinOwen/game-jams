# Game Jams

![Game Jam 4 Header](.github/assets/game-jam-4/header.png)

The Dojo Game Jam is back! This 72-hour weekend will bring together the Dojo ecosystem to build games on the open-source, provable Dojo Engine.

Prizes will be awarded to winning teams, but the goal of this game jam is to combine the efforts of those who share the vision of fully onchain games and to identify teams who are ready to build and ship!

If you‚Äôre ready to get involved and find a team, introduce yourself in the Dojo Discord - new contributors are always welcome. From there, the Dojo Book is a great place to start your journey.

## üéÅ  Prizes
